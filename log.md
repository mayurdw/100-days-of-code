# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 9th 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I started with 20 challenges on Free Code Camp

**Thoughts:** I wanted to start a project with Rails and Javascrip but I decided to take it a little slow today. Plus I needed a revision of CSS anyway.

### Day 5: January 13th 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I completed my tribute page with CodePen

### Day 9: January 17th 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I tried some different layouts for my portfolio

**Thoughts:** I was going to do some Javascript but if I could do the same without using jQuery or JS then what's the harm?
