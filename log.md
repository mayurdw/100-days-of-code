# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Januar 9th 2017 
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: I started with 20 challenges on Free Code Camp

**Thoughts:** I wanted to start a project with Rails and Javascrip but I decided to take it a little slow today. Plus I needed a revision of CSS anyway.
